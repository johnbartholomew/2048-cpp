Overview
--------

This is a C++ implementation of the '2048' game.
It is primarily inspired by this [HTML + Javascript version](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048)
by Gabriele Cirulli:

Key controls:

* Escape -- exit the program
* Arrow keys -- move
* 'n' -- new game
* 'h' -- make one auto-move
* 'p' -- toggle auto-play
* 'z' -- undo
* 'x' -- redo

Build requirements
------------------

* A C++ compiler (the Makefile uses g++)
* A C compiler (the Makefile uses gcc)
* GLFW 3 from http://www.glfw.org/
* The 'Clear Sans' font, from https://01.org/clear-sans (used in tiles.svg)
* Some way of rasterising an SVG file to an image (the Makefile uses Inkscape)

To Do
-----

Like any project, this one has an effectively infinite to-do list. Starting with the most interesting:

* Better board scoring heuristics (*many* possibilities here!)
* Alpha-Beta pruned minimax
* Alpha-Beta pruned minimax with caching
* Run the search in a background thread
* Iterative Deepening Depth First Search (with caching)
* Retaining cache state between moves during autoplay
* Game over message
* Game WIN message (with a button to continue playing after you hit it)
* Seed the RNG properly (but let the seed be controlled by a command line switch)
* Game scoring
* No-GUI autoplay mode for trialling variations to the AI

Beyond this point I will most likely have got bored and moved onto other projects:

* Actually multi-threaded search (ie, split a single search over multiple cores)
* Alternative basic search/AI algorithms (e.g., maximise *expected* board score rather than assuming antagonistic placement of new tiles?)
* A man-page
* On-screen help (showing keyboard controls)
* Run-time configuration (via command line or a config file) of board scoring heuristic, search algorithm, search depth/time, win condition
* High score table (offline/local only)
* Pack data (e.g., font) into the executable
* Autotools build
* Clean (schroot or similar) build script to produce distributable binaries
* Win32 build?
* Release!

Legal / Intellectual Property
-----------------------------

I did not invent this game. I copied the game idea, game rules, styling and
animation behaviour (inexactly) from https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048
I did not copy any of the code from that implementation, but I did copy some
stylistic things (e.g., colour values).  Gabriele Cirulli's implementation is
released under the MIT licence.

I did not create stb_image.c.  stb_image.c has been placed in the public domain
by its author(s) (Sean Barrett, plus contributors).

I *did* write the code in tiles2048.cpp, and the Makefile, and I created
the tiles.svg image.  I am releasing those files under the MIT licence:
